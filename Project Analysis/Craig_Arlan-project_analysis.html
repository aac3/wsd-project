    <h2> SITE INTENT</h2>
       <p>The website redesign intent is to change the coding errors, reorganize content,
          and provide a web environment that handles the needs of users and school staff. 
          Starting with the navigation that is very crowded and unusable by web standards. 
          The home page lacks presentation and can be a great source for quick information 
          like whats new, newsletters, and uniforms and supply list.  The redesign will take 
          the site from 21 pages down to 6 pages. This will organize content and place related 
          information in the same locations.  In addition, content on each page will use more 
          space than before.  This will help the target audience to find the information they 
          need to most.  By providing this redesign, the site will keep the target audience up 
          to date on school information, as well as, provide a site that is easy to navigate 
          and find content that is well organized.</p>
     
     <h2> COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
        <p>After doing some research on elementary schools in the area, I recommend that 
           Spring Lake Elementary should improve their section for parents, and students. 
           To be competitive to other elementary schools in the area, providing a section 
           just for parents to give them insight on how to register their child, a list of 
           the curriculum, and a printable page on uniforms and other school supplies. 
           In addition, allowing parents to have information on the administration and faculty 
           staff before enrolling their child will give them knowledge on who to talk to when 
           they arrive on campus. Providing the parents with information like this can be a big 
           boost in student enrollment and more parents visiting the website.</p>

     <h2> TARGETED AUDIENCE</h2>
          <p>The target audience is mostly females that are in the Florida area. They are 
             middle-aged mothers and grandmothers. These women are visiting the site mostly 
             from their homes at least 5.8 times a month. In addition, they spend on a monthly 
             average about 5.26 minutes on the site. The target audience uses the site for school 
             schedules, uniform and supply information, and PTA dates.  Redesigning the site 
             around this audience will help with more students having the right supplies and 
             uniform, as well as, having more parents at PTA meetings. Providing this features will 
             also boost traffic and time spent on the site.</p>
